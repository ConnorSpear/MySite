	  <p id="filler">Hello and welcome to my site! As you can probably tell this is definitely WIP and forever evolving.
		The purpose of this site is to showcase my skills and learn a new framework, while also showing you my accolades and achievements.
		This site is created using the <a id="django" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django project</a> framework. Therefore,
		I have developed this site using HTML, CSS and and some JavaScript to run the front end, and Python taking control of the backend.
		For version control and deployment of any updates, I have used Git, you can check out this source code on Github
	  </p>

		  As a quick work summary, I recently worked for Spark New Zealand, a leading telecommunications company in New Zealand, my role at Spark was an 'Analytics Specialist' with the 
		  product data squad, my main technologies used were Snowflake SQL, PowerBI, Python's Pandas, Azure and some Azure Data Factory. Overtime, during this role I developed a knack
		  for clean and recyclable code, whether that be advanced SQL queries, python scripts or PowerBI reports which allowed my colleagues to easily pick up and understand what work I had done.
		  Read more about my work experiences <a id="django" href="experience.html">here!</a>

		  On a personal note, I am an avid footballer, playing since 'the midgets' (5th grade), this has taught me about working as a team and contributing where and how
		  my team needs it. I am a keen programmer and problem solver, since university I have had many personal projects including, this website, creating a sudoku solver 
		  using Java and creating the game snake using JavaScript!
